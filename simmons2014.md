## 1 Introduction

_'We are slaves because normal employees have a voice, but we do not...didn't expect this when we signed the contract, but once on the boat in New Zealand we are trapped...we were trapped into modern slavery.'_

New Zealand is widely regarded as having a comprehensive and sophisticated fisheries management system [1]. Based on a competitive market-based approach, it is underpinned by individual transferable quotas (ITQs) in order to provide certainty of returns and incentives for economic and social efficiency, thus encouraging maximum value to be sustainably extracted from fishery resources. It also enables 'fishers to efficiently manage their own affairs' [2], encouraging investment, innovation, and rationalisation leading to more productive capital and labour [3]. A key economic objective of the system is the minimisation of harvesting costs, particularly costs associated with capital and labour. In the years preceding its introduction the industry was in a state of crisis [4]. Many operators were losing money, and could not afford much needed maintenance or to pay decent wages. Shortly after being established the system was described as a promising innovation to revolutionise fisheries management [2] which would lead to improved catch monitoring, resource management and productivity [5].

Since this early analysis a number of reports have confirmed the success of the fisheries management system e.g. [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Annala [7] noted that 'there has been increased industry responsibility in the conduct of their fishing operations', while Pearse [11] found economic performance had much improved. Bess [8] confirmed seafood businesses had gained a competitive advantage through'substantial capital investments in world-class fishing vessels...and processing facilities.' Others, however, e.g. [12, 13, 14, 15, 16] argued that success claims were unproven. In a corrective to the'success rhetoric Rees [14] found that it is 'fallacious' to suggest that the fisheries management system had improved socio-economic performance due to its impact on small independent fishermen, fishing communities, or its long term impact on the industry because of the reduced skill base following rationalisation.

New Zealand companies first began using foreign charter fishing vessels (FCVs) in the late 1970s and their use was further encouraged and facilitated by the government's neo-liberal reforms, introduced in the mid-1980s [17]. Initially, FCVs were seen as a way for the industry to develop New Zealand's exclusive economic zone with 'an influx of new ideas, different technologies and ways of fishing' [14]. Operators argued that FCVs are the most efficient and flexible method of maximising economic returns [18]. In the 2011 there were 27 FCVs, harvesting about 40 per cent of New Zealand's total allowable commercial catch [19]. Of these 13 were South Korean flagged, manned by migrant Asian workers. The majority of the South Korean FCVs were older vessels that hadoperated in New Zealand's waters for more than two decades and significantly had not advanced the industry technologically [20, 21].

Exploitative labour conditions are often associated with illegal, unregulated and unreported (IIU) fishing vessels and unregulated fisheries, and not a feature of well managed fisheries, such as those in Canada, Iceland and New Zealand. Yet, despite New Zealand's fisheries management system being recognised internationally as world leading [1, 22, 23], there have been significant problems aboard many FCVs fishing legally in New Zealand waters. In fact, the exploitation of foreign fishing crew has been a feature of the New Zealand deep sea fishing industry for over three decades [24]. In the 1990s exploitative labour practices aboard FCVs were being debated in Parliament. One Member stated: 'we have closed our eyes at home...to those abuses occurring under our noses...we cannot have a commercial fishing industry develop on the backs of Third World exploited labour' [25]. While another Member pointed out 'that some of the quota holders refuse to pay New Zealand noses. they bring in joint-venture vessels, pay the crews $1 a day, then reap a reward through what we would call unfair labour practices' [26]. Claims of human rights abuses, modern day slavery and appalling conditions continued to surface in Parliament over the next two decades [27, 28, 29]. Despite the government undertaking a range of initiatives to improve conditions aboard FCVs, problems remained.

In May 2011, Indonesian crew from the chartered South Korean fishing vessel _Shin Ji2_ refused to work citing over-work and abuse by their Korean officers along with the non-payment of wages. They were followed by migrant crew from other South Korean vessels [24, 30, 31] resulting in a wave of publicity and a public outry about the exploitation of migrant fishing crew in New Zealand [32, 33, 34, 35]. This led to the authors interviewing around 300 people, including foreign crew members, observers and industry personnel. The foreign crew had worked on 13 FCVs fishing in New Zealand waters. The majority were serving crew, but some had returned home to Asia, while others were deserters and hiding from authorities. This paper is a case study of the forced labour practices towards the crew of one FCV, the _Shin Ji_. The case highlights the use of exploitative labour practices to minimise harvesting costs in the pursuit of economic efficiency. It outlines the recruitment, vulnerability, and exploitation of the _Shin Ji_ crew in New Zealand and their eventual return home after being threatened with deportation.

Footnote 2: The _Shin Ji_ was chartered by Turere Fishing Limited a New Zealand company.

The paper proceeds as follows. Section Two discusses the methodology and introduces the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Indicators of Forced Labour. Section Three provides additional background information on the regulatory environment in New Zealand and the introduction of a non-binding Code of Practice. Empirical evidence of deceptive and coercive labour practices based on the ILO Indicators of Forced Labour are discussed in Section Four. Section Five discusses the findings and concluding thoughts about New Zealand's market-based fisheries management system which has perversely effectuated economic efficiency.

## 2 Research framework

Forced labour is a gross violation of human rights and according to the ILO 'almost all cases of human trafficking result in forced labour' [36]. The ILO Forced Labour Convention 1930 (No. 29) defines forced labour as 'all work or service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntary' [37]. This includes all types of work, whether legal or not. 'Menace of penalty' encompasses the loss of any right or privilege, or imposition of any sanction through coercion. Even if a person has voluntarily entered into an employment relationship, their 'free and informed consent is negated by deception or coercion of the employer or recruiter' [38]. Eleven Indicators of Forced Labour have been identified by the ILOS Special Action Programme to Combat Forced Labour (SAP-FL) [37]. These are listed in Table 1. While the presence of one indicator may be indicative of forced labour, in the majority of cases forced labour occurs where there are several indicators.

Semi-structured interviews in New Zealand and Indonesia were undertaken with twelve crew members who worked on the _Shin Ji_ between 2009 and 2011. Access to the crew was initially gained through the Indonesian Society in New Zealand. Interviews were conducted using Indonesian translators and lasted between one to four hours with follow up interviews undertaken. Semi-structured interviews were also undertaken with industry personnel and New Zealanders involved with the crew. In order to verify interview data individual pay slips, crew bank statements, and photographs of working and living conditions were obtained. The crew also provided recordings of their conversations with their employer and agents. Additionally, information pertaining to Ministerial communication was obtained under the Official Information Act 1982.

## 3 Setting the scene

In 2006 a non-binding Code of Practice on Foreign Fishing Crews and a new immigration policy for the issuing of crew work visas was introduced following increased desertions and continual reports of abuse aboard some FCVs. Authored by the Department of Labour, the Seafood Industry Council and the New Zealand Fishing Industry Guild, the purpose of the Code of Practice was to ensure 'the highest level of compliance in relation to both immigration requirements and applicable laws of New Zealand' [39]. The Code outlined that crew must receive decent treatment and that the New Zealand companies undertook to monitor this. It also outlined that the crew must be paid fair pay3 meaning the wages paid to crew should be reflective of local New Zealand rates, but in no case should wages (inclusive of deductions) fall below the rates governed by the Minimum Wage Act 1983. Beginning 1 January 2009, crew were entitled to be paid the minimum hourly rate of SNZ12.50 an hour ($US7.50)4 plus an additional SNZ2.00 an hour ($US120). But, the provisions of the Employment Relations Act 2000, the Holidays Act 2003 and the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992 did not apply to FCVs. Thus, the Code of Practice only reflected the Minimum Wages Act 1983 and the Wages Protection Act 1983. In other words, the normal protections inherent in New Zealand's domestic suite of labour legislation were not (and continue not to be) available to the crew of FCV vessels as they are beyond the reach of the Code [20, 21]. Furthermore, the preamble to the Code of Practice stated that fishing industry participants did not agree to the minimum wage requirements.

## 4 The trajectory to forced labour

### Recruitment

The majority of the crew came from the Tegal region in Central Java, one of the most impoverished areas of Indonesia. This is a region characterised by high unemployment with a large percentage of people living under the poverty line (approx. SUS75 per month). Hence, an offer of SUS200-500 per month to work on a fishing vessel in New Zealand was attractive. Crew were recruited through family contacts and other crew, through recruiting brokers, or directly by manning (recruitment) agents who advertise in local newspapers. We know the agent usually through friends or family and even though [the contact person] was not satisfied with the agent, have no choice as we are jobless, we can't find a job and have to be independent to help our parents, so our last choice is to work for the agent.5

Footnote 6: Interviewee 7.

Footnote 7: See footnote 6.

Crew had to provide condition precedent guarantees and securities to the manning agency and several were required to pay a cash bond of up to SUS300. They were also required to hand over birth certificates, family identity documents, and education certificates; hence the agent effectively 'takes my family's, and my, identity.6 Birth, education and family identity documents are difficult and costly to replace and in some instances, education courses would have to be retaken if the manning agent did not return the documents. A manning agent told one crew member 'if you didn't give these things for the guarantee we won't transfer money to your wife.7 On signing their contract with the manning agent, crew agreed 'to be completely submissive and obedient to the rule established by The First Party [manning agent].8 The crew were flown to New Zealand with the cost, albeit at an inflated level, deducted from future wages.

### Exploitation aboard the Shin Ji

The May 2011 walkout was not the first recorded incident of problems aboard the _Shin Ji_. The vessel first arrived in New Zealand in 2009 and a few months later, eleven Indonesian crew filed the vessel handing themselves into the Police. They spent the night as vagrants in the custody of the Auckland Police and the next day, Maritime Union officials transferred the crew to the Auckland International Seafarers Centre. The men resolutely refused to return to their vessel alleging ill-treatment by its Korean officers - weekly salt water showers, no hot water and no pay for four months' [40]. International Transport Federation Inspector, Grahame McLaren negotiated with the New Zealand charter agent on behalf of the crew and in total the crew received $N252,775 ($US34,130)9 in wages and were reprinted to Indonesia. Terry Nobs of the Seafarers Centre was firmly of the opinion that the New Zealand agent was more anxious about getting the _Shin Ji_ back to sea than concerned about the welfare of the crew [40].

Two years later, in May 2011 other _Shin Ji_ crew members refused to work despite being threatened that they 'will be sent home and not get paid.'10 As with the earlier crew members, they cited abusive working and living conditions, the non-payment of wages, excessive working shifts, as well as sexual abuse. Earlier that year, the Bosun drowned while clearing a blockage in an eel tank aboard the vessel11 and half of the crew traumatised by his death returned home after breaking their contracts. The remaining seven crew, were required to do the work of fourteen. They repeatedly asked for more help and by May the situation had reached breaking point. Early one morning the captain woke the senior oiler - who was forced to illegally work as the Chief Engineer - demanding he turn on the generator. The oiler refused and was abused by the captain. He recalled telling the captain 'I'm not the chief engineer and have no qualifications; it's illegal if I do it and I don't want the responsibility to do it anymore.12

that the manning agent would not pay them their unpaid salary. 'Every month [their employee] was supposed to transfer our salary to Indonesia, but sometimes he doesn't do this for two or three months so we don't really know what's been paid to Indonesia'.29 The crew refused to leave until they received their wages as well as other money withheld by the manning agent: 'it has to be paid to us here before we leave, we won't get it in Indonesia, this happened to other crew'.30 While at the safe house, the crew members were visited by Immigration New Zealand (INZ) officials and an Indonesian translator who had also acted for their New Zealand employer during the industrial dispute. The presence of the translator caused the crew to 'lose trust' in INZ and heightened their fears about talking to government officials. Crew were required to sign a document and were told by the translator 'you have to sign this document which I have been told is deportation of criminals'.31 The crew members reluctantly signed. Two days later a Senior INZ official visited and provided them with airline tickets. According to their host, the crew members were informed they must depart New Zealand in the morning otherwise they will be deported and 'banned from working in the Commonwealth for five years'.32

This caused a reporter to seek clarification from INZ's CEO,33 who confirmed that the crew had been given the opportunity to depart voluntarily and that they had been served with Deportation Liability Notices. INZ's position was that 'there was no longer any requirement for the crew to remain in New Zealand'. However, the crew refused to leave until they were paid as they had no money to travel from Jakarta airport to their villages in Tegal, a six hour drive. Following the crew's claims for unpaid wages the New Zealand charter party, a guarantor for the payment of their wages, placed itself in voluntary administration in late June 2011. This left little recourse for the crew who finally returned home three months after first engaging in industrial action.

### Return to Indonesia

On their return home, the seven _Shin Ji_ crew visited their manning agent in Jakarta who returned their securities, but refused to pay them the retained portion of their salaries. All were blacklisted by their manning agent. Eventually their lawyer accepted on their behalf an offer of SN26,000 each (SU55,000)34 in full and final settlement of the SN21,121,525 (SU5933,700)35 owed in unpaid wages [41]. When the authors visited the former crew members in Tegal, one had started a small pancake business, while others were using their money to stave off abject poverty as they remained blacklisted, unemployed and destitute.

## 5 Discussion

This case study explains how a group of Indonesian migrant fishermen came to New Zealand for the purpose of earning a decent income and instead, became victims of forced labour (see Table 2). While low wages and poor working conditions are by themselves not symptomatic of forced labour, the treatment the _Shin Ji_ crew endured illuminates a number of dimensions, of the ILO's definition of forced labour, including: debt bondage, retention of identity documents, intimidation and threats, inhumane living and working conditions, and withholding of wages. While the exploitation of labour took place in New Zealand waters, the trajectory to forced labour began in Indonesia where the manning agent engaged in financial exploitation. Aboard the vessel crew were subject to physical, sexual and psychological abuse - a gross violation of their human rights.

Crew were asked why they endured the abusive treatment. One responded: 'we are afraid because we have signed the contract, we have family, and they have our certificates. When you sign the contract, you don't expect these things to happen in New Zealand...too late once on the boat, 1 am trapped'.36 All crew commented that it was not easy to leave their vessel as the New Zealand agent retained their passports and seaman's books. Yet, when the crew sought to take action, officials appeared more concerned with encouraging the crew to leave New Zealand. The Department of Labour's (DoL) own investigation highlighted that the Department had historically, been 'unwilling or unable to fully resolve problems in the industry.37 This lack of action '...has allowed the situation to deteriorate...and this lack of oversight allowed the operators of many FCVs to exploit crew members under their control.' Consequently, not only is there an institutional void in New Zealand's exclusive economic zone [30], but there is also an absence of responsibility and accountability. This research found that for the crew members of the _Shin Ji_, and indeed many other foreign fishing crews, a self-regulation approach has failed. In spite of domestic laws, strict work visa requirements and the Code of Practice on Foreign Fishing Crew, operators of the _Shin Ji_ flouted their ethical and legal responsibilities to monitor and ensure crew had decent work and living conditions. What's more, crew were required to engage in a range of illegal activities, including the illegal dumping of rubbish and quota species. If widespread this distorts catch statistics and is a threat to the integrity of the quota management system [42]. The crew reported that indeed, high-grading activities were deliberate, systematic, and extensive.

Footnote 37: Department of Labour Memorandum on Assessment of information re fishing industry: released under Official Information Act request, 6 June 2012.

This case study clearly shows that New Zealand's fisheries management system has 'not delivered on its promise of responsible fishers with long time horizons' [12]. The deliberate exploitation of migrant fishing crew, thus calls into question the success of New Zealand's system, due to its failure to achieve social outcomes. An important social and political objective of the system was to improve economic returns, including raising income levels within the industry. Success claims have excluded the labour dimension, particularly the perspectives of the workers themselves. Unless the real impact of the fisheries management system on income levels and labour conditions is properly understood, it is naive to suggest that New Zealand's fishery management system has been a success. Future studies should place a much heavier onus on social responsibility factors, particularly the labour dimension.

## 6 Conclusion

This case study adds the much needed labour dimension into the debate about New Zealand's market-based fishery management system. New Zealand's system is advocated as world leading and economically efficient, but for whom? Certainly, not the crew of the _Shin Ji_ and their families, and this is to say nothing about the reputational damage to New Zealand's image. Indeed, the system appears to have perversely effectuated economic efficiency. Having the fishing industry develop on the backs of forced labour is moryally indefensible and cannot be justified as an efficient rational economic activity. Ultimately, the economic performance of the industry as well as the fairness and effectiveness of the fisheries management system are not matters to be closeted away 'within closed fisheries circles, they are issues of great concern for the public at large' [43]. This case study found social outcomes are of crucial importance. Other studies have shown that the introduction of fisheries management systems in other countries, such as Canada and Iceland has led to increased safety, higher wages and better working conditions [44]. Yet, unlike those countries New Zealand's fisheries management policies have over several decades, encouraged and facilitated the use of low-cost FCVs, manned by migrant workers, with the profit motive disconnected from stewardship objectives.

This study highlights that 'economic principles are clearly not the only factors that may require attention or action from a government or regulator' [45]. The ILO points out fisheries management policies can either facilitate or deter the use of forced labour in the fisheries sector [38]. Oversight and transparency-enhancing measures created to address violations or avoidance of fisheries regulations should be extended to cover labour practices. For too long New Zealand Government fisheries policies have facilitated the use of forced labour. Only now is New Zealand beginning to head in the right direction with major policy and legislative reforms underway, to enhance the robustness of its fisheries management regime. In fact, the 'aim is to send a clear message that all vessels operating in New Zealand waters must fully meet New Zealand employment, vessel safety, and fisheries laws' [46]. Principally this involves reflaging FCVs to New Zealand, increasing official observer coverage and extending their powers to cover crew employment, health and safety, and vessel pollution matters. Additionally, as vessel operators are subject to licencing, social responsibility obligations are becoming a condition of obtaining and retaining a fishing licence. However, the legislation has yet to be enacted and only, time will tell if these policy interventions are effective. Ultimately, until this most evil of exploitation' [47] is eliminated from New Zealand's waters, New Zealand cannot claim to have a world leading fisheries management regime.
